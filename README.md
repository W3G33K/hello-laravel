# hello-laravel

### "Hello, world!" for the modern developer.
The tradition "Hello, World!" programs date back to circa-1978 (give or take). This example program, hello-laravel, 
takes that traditional "Hello, world!" webapp concept and flips it onto it's head by showing off more syntax of a given 
programming language, in this specific-case extremely modern PHP development using a modern toolchain with whiskeybox 
and Laravel.

## What's a whiskeybox?
Quiet simply everything the modern sophisticated-developer needs in order to build out rich and robust PHP applications.

The TLDR; whiskeybox is a pre-configured virtual machine that comes with a full array of features. At its core it's an 
LAMP Stack hand-crafted and brewed from scratch for vagrant. Over time, it has grown and became so much more by 
adding in features such as phpMyAdmin, NodeJS toolchaining and Python support.

If you already have the up to date versions of Vagrant and Virtualbox installed no provisioning tools or extensive setup 
is required to use whiskeybox. Since everything comes pre-packaged on the virtual machine itself, running 
`cd /path/to/whiskeybox-vagrantfile && vagrant up` is all you'll ever need to worry about.

You'll be taking shots of whiskey before you know it! üçª
